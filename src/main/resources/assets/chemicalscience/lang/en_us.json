  "guidebook.chemicalscience.chapter.generalchemistry": "General Chemistry",
  "guidebook.chemicalscience.chapter.generalchemistry.l1": "\"Chemistry is the study of change\" - Walter White. More seriously, to understand chemistry you need to understand what and atom is. Matter in general contains atoms and energy. The energy is the motion of the particles inside of the atoms. And atom contains 3 types of particle, protons which have a postive charge, electron which have a negative charge, and neutrons, which don't have any charge. Like a magnet, protons and electrons atract each other, because of the charge difference. Protons and neutrons are found in the nucleus, which represent practically all of the atom's mass. Electrons gravitates around the nucleus. The more energy they contain, the farther away they are from the nucleus, at a point where some can move away definitely from the atom. Here is an example of a Helium atom, with in green, the 2 neutrons, in red, the 2 protons, in blue, the 2 electrons and in yellow, a representation of the attraction between protons and electrons.\n\n",
  "guidebook.chemicalscience.chapter.generalchemistry.l2": "If you understand that the nucleus has the mass, the electrons can move away from the atom with energy, and that to be stable, charges must compensate, every chemistry aspects can be explained from there.",
  "guidebook.chemicalscience.chapter.generalchemistry.l3": "There are at this time 118 differents atoms known. But how do you differentiate them? The number of neutrons? It can vary from one an other and the atom stills keep its properties. The mass? If the number of neutron vary, the mass does too. The number of electrons? Electrons are the interesting part of an atom because they explain most of its behaviour, but if you kept track, I mentionned that electrons can move away. Then there is the number of protons, because an atom must have as much postive charges as negative ones, protons will account for the stable number of electrons, as well as representing most of the mass in small atoms. That way, the periodic table sorts the atom by the number of protons, which is why Helium, is number two!",
  "guidebook.chemicalscience.chapter.generalchemistry.l4": "So, the order is the number of protons, but why does it look like shit? Well, nucleus have electrons orbiting around them, but you would not put 118 electrons on a single orbital without some traffic issues, so to make things more complicated, atoms have multiple orbitals. An orbital isn't litteraly a circle around the nucleus but more of an area where each electrons have a chance to be. For Hydrogen and Helium, there is a single one next to the nucleus, with two space. For an atom to be stable, the orbitals must be saturated in electrons. In order to do so, two Hydrogen atoms will go next to each other and form a bond, which is just sharing their single electrons with each other. In this way, you can deduce that the first row of atoms have one orbital, the second has two, third has three, etc. The blue and the green line are part of the 6th and 7th lines, but the periodic table would be even more horrible looking if you shoved those two rows in between. \nAnd that is it for this chapter, atoms contains a nucleus which is most of their mass, electrons orbit around it, and for an atom to be stable, it must have a neutral charge and full orbitals.",
  
  "guidebook.chemicalscience.chapter.organicchemistry": "Organic Chemistry",
  "guidebook.chemicalscience.chapter.organicchemistry.l1": "Organic chemistry is the study of chemistry focused on the Carbon atom. Life on Earth is carbon-based, meaning the element that constitute the skeleton of molecules in plants, animals, fungi, every life in general, is carbon. But organic chemistry isn't just the base of biology, it is also the base of today's technology. Your phone, or maybe your computer might have an OLED screen, which stands for organic light emiting diodes. Why organic? Because it is made out of carbon, and that is why it is so good. Carbon electronics have the properties of being extremely resistent to being stretched, they do not use rare earth metals, they are not toxic, they can be way, way more powerful while consuming a lot less energy. I hope you know your chemistry or read the previous chapter, you will need it to understand this one.",
  "guidebook.chemicalscience.chapter.organicchemistry.l2": "The carbon atom has 6 protons and 6 to 8 neutrons. If it has 6 electrons, the first two will be located on the first electron orbital, like helium, and won't bound. The other four will do something called hybridisation, which let them bound with 4 other electrons. Carbon can bound with other atoms in 3 ways :",
  "guidebook.chemicalscience.chapter.organicchemistry.l3": "The straight lines are in 2D, in the same plan. On the carbon atom to the right, you can see 2 bounds in the same plan and 2 weird ones. The full triangle goes on top of the the plan, the other goes below the plan. This is called Cram's representation, it represents atoms in 3D. The most used representation is called topology, it shows every bounds without showing every carbons and hydrogens. For exemple, the molecule of Propane, which is 3 carbons boundings in a single chain, with hydrogens bounding with carbons in order to fill the orbitals, will look like this :",
  "guidebook.chemicalscience.chapter.organicchemistry.l4": "On the left is a classic representation, taking a lot of space, and on the right is the topological representation, where only the carbon-carbon bound is shown, and an angle is made, accounting to the 3D geometry of the carbon atom. Every molecules added by Chemical Science is in the guidebook, check it out! ",
  "guidebook.chemicalscience.chapter.organicchemistry.l5": "We are going to jump a little bit in difficulty, because how the f* can this produce electricity? Well, it isn't simple. Carbon can make bounds with other atoms, but they can bound more than once. You know about Dioxygen? Oxygen bounds two time with other atoms, so dioxygen is just two oxygens bounding twice with each other. If you remember well, a bound is just atoms sharing electrons. With a single bound, it is easy, it's just a straight line showing the region where electrons have the most chance to be in. But with two bounds, the single bound is still in the same place, and the second covers the single one.",
  "guidebook.chemicalscience.chapter.organicchemistry.l6": "In orange is a single bound, and in green a second bound. The carbons on the right bound two times with eachother. The name for a single bound is σ (sigma) and for a double bound is π (pi). A triple bound would be one σ and two π. π bounds have the ability to move in the molecule. This two Bromobenzene molecules are the same, but the π bounds changed positions :",
  "guidebook.chemicalscience.chapter.organicchemistry.l7": "On top of that, this particular molecule also has a bromine atom, which has 6 electrons forming 3 non-convalent bounds, that can move around with π bounds. The phenomenom of electrons moving in a molecule is called a conjugated system. There are 4 major types of conjugated system, π-σ-π, which is the one in Benzene, consisting of π bounds covering σ bounds; π-σ-n, with n being a non-covalent bound; π-σ-ν, with ν being the lack of electrons of an atom; and n-σ-ν. A conjugated system size depend on how many of this types follow each other. The bigger the conjugated system, the better it absorbs light for exemple. This is why carrots are orange, because they contain β-Carotene which has a very long conjugated system. ",
  "guidebook.chemicalscience.chapter.organicchemistry.l8": "You can see the conjugated system highlighted in purple, consisting of π-σ-π units. Those electrons are able to absorb light around 450nm (cyan), which is the complementary color of orange. Therefore, cyan is fully absorbed and the carrot emits the orange light it couldn't absorb. By absorbing light, the electrons move away more from the molecule (chapter on general chemistry), and can be used to make current. This is how an organic solar panel works, we use a polymer (chain of the same molecule, repeating multiple times) with a conjugated system, and by repeating the molecule we increase the size of the conjugated system to make it absord more and more light. In Chemical Science, we use Poly[3,6-bis(5-thiophen-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-octyldodecyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole1,4(2H,5H)-dione-2,2’-diyl-alt- thieno[3,2-b]thiophen-2,5-diyl], which is kindly abreviated as DPP-DTT polymer. ",

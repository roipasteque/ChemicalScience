  "guidebook.chemicalscience.chapter.generalchemistry.l1": "\" Chemistry is the study of change\" - Walter White. More seriously, to understand chemistry you need to understand what and atom is. Matter in general contains atoms and energy. The energy is the motion of the particles inside of the atoms. And atom contains 3 types of particle, protons which have a postive charge, electron which have a negative charge, and neutrons, which don't have any charge. Like a magnet, protons and electrons atract each other, because of the charge difference. Protons and neutrons are found in the nucleus, which represent practically all of the atom's mass. Electrons gravitates around the nucleus. The more energy they contain, the farther away they are from the nucleus, at a point where some can move away definitely from the atom. Here is an example of a Helium atom, with in green, the 2 neutrons, in red, the 2 protons, in blue, the 2 electrons and in yellow, a representation of the attraction between protons and electrons.\n\n",
  "guidebook.chemicalscience.chapter.generalchemistry.l2": "If you understand that the nucleus has the mass, the electrons can move away from the atom with energy, and that to be stable, charges must compensate, every chemistry aspects can be explained from there.",
  "guidebook.chemicalscience.chapter.generalchemistry.l3": "There are at this time 118 differents atoms known. But how do you differentiate them? The number of neutrons? It can vary from one an other and the atom stills keep its properties. The mass? If the number of neutron vary, the mass does too. The number of electrons? Electrons are the interesting part of an atom because they explain most of its behaviour, but if you kept track, I mentionned that electrons can move away. Then there is the number of protons, because an atom must have as much postive charges as negative ones, protons will account for the stable number of electrons, as well as representing most of the mass in small atoms. That way, the periodic table sorts the atom by the number of protons, which is why Helium, is number two!",
  "guidebook.chemicalscience.chapter.generalchemistry.l4": "So, the order is the number of protons, but why does it look like shit? Well, nucleus have electrons orbiting around them, but you would not put 118 electrons on a single orbital without some traffic issues, so to make things more complicated, atoms have multiple orbitals. An orbital isn't litteraly a circle around the nucleus but more of an area where each electrons have a chance to be. For Hydrogen and Helium, there is a single one next to the nucleus, with two space. For an atom to be stable, the orbitals must be saturated in electrons. In order to do so, two Hydrogen atoms will go next to each other and form a bond, which is just sharing their single electrons with each other. In this way, you can deduce that the first row of atoms have one orbital, the second has two, third had three, etc. The blue and the green line are part of the 6th and 7th lines, but the periodic table would be even more horrible looking if you shoved those two rows in between. \nAnd that is it for this chapter, atoms contains a nucleus which is most of their mass, electrons orbit around it, and for an atom to be stable, it must have a neutral charge and full orbitals.",
